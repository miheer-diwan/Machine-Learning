# Softmax Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent

## Overview

This project involves implementing softmax regression and a fully connected neural network with stochastic gradient descent in Python 3. 
   - Developed and tested several functions for softmax regression using Python.
   - Validated implementations using unit tests to ensure correctness and efficiency.

## Files

- **problem1.py**: Contains the implementation of several functions for softmax regression. The input and output of the functions should not be changed.
- **test1.py**: Includes unit tests to validate the implementation of softmax regression. Run using `nosetests -v test1.py`.
