# Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

In this part of the project, we use neural networks to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST Database. This involves implementing and experimenting with different network architectures and hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance. 

- **Implemented and Evaluated Neural Networks**: Developed and assessed neural network models for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset, achieving high accuracy with various network configurations.

- **Optimized Model Performance**: Conducted experiments with different hyperparameters, including epochs, hidden units, and learning rates, to optimize model performance and accuracy. Achieved significant improvements in prediction rates through hyperparameter tuning.

- **Analyzed Results and Findings**: Summarized experimental results in a detailed table, identifying the best-performing network configuration and gaining insights into the effects of different hyperparameters on model performance.

- **Applied Theoretical Knowledge**: Applied concepts from "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael A. Nielsen to practical implementation, leveraging Python 3 tools to achieve robust model performance.

- **Enhanced Predictive Accuracy**: Proposed and tested advanced strategies, such as experimenting with different activation functions and regularization techniques, to further enhance the neural network's predictive accuracy.

## Learnings

- **Effect of Epochs**: Increasing or decreasing the number of epochs affected the model's convergence and performance.
- **Impact of Hidden Units**: The number of hidden units influenced the model's ability to learn complex patterns.
- **Learning Rate**: The learning rate (Î·) played a critical role in the optimization process and convergence speed.
- **Activation Functions**: Different activation functions had varying effects on the network's ability to generalize.

## Future Work

To further improve prediction rates:
