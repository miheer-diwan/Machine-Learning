# Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent

## Project Overview

In this assignment, we implemented logistic regression using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in Python 3. The goal was to update model parameters (theta, including weights `w` and bias `b`) based on individual training examples to optimize logistic regression performance.

## Files Provided

- **part1.py**: Contains the functions to be implemented. Ensure that the input and output specifications remain unchanged.
- **test1.py**: Includes unit tests for validating the implementation. Run this file using `nosetests -v test1.py` to check the correctness of the functions.

## Implementation Details

- **Algorithm**: Implemented logistic regression using stochastic gradient descent, where parameters are updated with each training example.
- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Testing**: Verified implementation with provided unit tests to ensure accuracy and functionality.
