# Decision Tree with Discrete Attributes

## Overview

This project involves implementing the decision tree algorithm for a classification problem using discrete attributes in Python 3. The project is divided into two parts: implementing a decision tree and applying it to a credit risk prediction problem.

## Files

- **data1.csv**: Contains the dataset for building and evaluating the decision tree. The first row is the header, and the first column is the target label.
- **part1.py**: Contains the implementation of the decision tree functions. The input and output of the functions should not be changed.
- **test1.py**: Includes unit tests to validate the implementation. Run using `nosetests -v test1.py`.

## Implementation

### Part 1: Implement Decision Tree with Discrete Attributes

In `part1.py`, several functions are implemented to build a decision tree using discrete attributes from the dataset provided in `data1.csv`. The performance of the decision tree is then evaluated.

### Part 2: Credit Risk Prediction

In this part, a decision tree is built using the `credit.txt` dataset to predict the credit risk of individuals based on features such as debt, income, marital status, property ownership, and gender.
A decision tree is drawn and reported using visualization tools like Graphviz or text representation. The decision tree is used to predict the credit risk of two individuals, Tom and Ana.
