# SVM with Linear Kernel Implementation

## Project Overview

In this assignment, you will implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel using subgradient methods in Python 3. The focus is on implementing the core functions for training and evaluating the SVM model.

## Files Provided

- **problem1.py**: Contains the functions that need to be implemented. Ensure that you adhere to the specified input and output formats.
- **test1.py**: Includes unit tests to verify the implementation. Run this file using the command `nosetests -v test1.py` to check if your functions work as expected.

## Implementation Details

- **Algorithm**: Implemented an SVM with a linear kernel using subgradient descent for optimization.
- **Programming Language**: Python 3
